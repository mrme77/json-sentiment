    "According to the website article [theMusic](https://themusic.com.au/news/scientists-reveal-the-happiest-song-of-all-time/hkqSmJuanZw/17-02-23), \"good vibrations\" by The Beach Boys is considered the number one happiest song; and the polarity score generated by our function closely matches that. Conversely, \"I will always love you\" by Whitney Houston is considered one of the saddest song according to an article from [WGNA](https://wgntv.com/news/wgn-news-now/whats-the-saddest-song-of-all-time/), yet it scores a moderate positive sentiment which doesn't match the article findings. The remaining songs, which I would argue to be sad songs, do score either neutral or slightly positive sentiment. I believe that there are may be sevearl reasons that may cause the polarity of a song to not always align perfectly with an individual's perception. Some of these include context which makes lyrics opent to interpration of the song also based on the melody, rhythm, or the artist's delivery. There is an interesting article about the impact of negative harmony on polarity [Negative Harmony: Experiments with the Polarity in Music](https://dc.etsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1614&context=honors). Another aspect to consider is that some lyrics may include methapors which sentiment analysis algorithms may struggle to capture. "
